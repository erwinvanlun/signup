- Using Angular 18.3 
- I have used Angular 18 for this project, as requested. As I didn't have experience with standalone components nor with signals, this part might not be ideal. For the unit test of the standalone components I made use of ChatGPT. 
- storybook with Cypress could be used for extended testing and improved development experience
- implemented basic accessibility wit the use of ChatGPT.
