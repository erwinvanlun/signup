# Signup

# Contents

| App # | app-name | Description                                      | 
|-------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | signup   | Demo application for self registration of a user |

Once the app is running, after entering valid information, the 'signup' button will be enabled. On click, the registration will be completed. This will typically succeed and result is logged in the console. In case an error occurs, this is also logged in the console.

## Comments
- Using Angular 18.0.5
- Using StandAlone component for SignUp (first time I was working with StandAlone components)
- Would have loved to dive into NgRx Signals Store for cross component communication but to far fetched for now.
- Implemented basic accessibility  (not used to this)
